What's in this picture?
Looks like a duck.
That¡¦s not a duck. Then 
what¡¦s it?
Looks more like a 
bunny.
Why?
It has bunny ears.Description of three toed 
woodpecker: It has black 
and white stripes 
throughout the body and a 
yellow crown.
Description of downy 
woodpecker: It has white 
spots on its black wings 
and some red on its crown.
Question: what is the 
name of the 
woodpecker in the 
picture?
Downy

Figure 1: KOSMOS -1is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that is capable of perceiving
multimodal input, following instructions, and performing in-context learning for not only language
tasks but also multimodal tasks. In this work, we align vision with large language models (LLMs),
advancing the trend of going from LLMs to MLLMs.
