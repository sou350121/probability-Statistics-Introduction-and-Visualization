Introduction:
    also known as the Sampling Theorem or the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula, 
    is a fundamental theorem in signal processing that describes 
    the minimum sampling rate required to accurately reconstruct 
    a continuous-time signal from its samples. It states that 
    a continuous-time signal can be reconstructed perfectly from its samples 
    if the sampling rate is at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal.

    x(t) = âˆ‘n x[n]sinc((t - nT)/T)
    where T = 1/fs is the sampling period, sinc is the sinc function, and x[n] 
    are the samples of the continuous-time signal x(t) taken at the times nT.
