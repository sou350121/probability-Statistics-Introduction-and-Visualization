Introduction

    u(t) = Kp * e(t) + Ki * âˆ«e(t)dt + Kd * de(t)/dt
    where u(t) is the control signal, e(t) is the error between the setpoint 
    and the measured variable, Kp, Ki, and Kd are the gains of 
    the P, I, and D components, respectively, and de(t)/dt is the derivative of 
    the error with respect to time.
    
    - Proportional (P) component: This component provides a response proportional to 
    the error between the desired setpoint and the measured process variable. 
    The P component alone can cause overshoot and oscillations in the response.
    - Integral (I) component: This component provides a response proportional to 
    the integral of the error over time. The I component alone can eliminate 
    the steady-state error, but can cause a slow response.
    - Derivative (D) component: This component provides a response proportional to 
    the derivative of the error over time. The D component alone can improve 
    the stability of the system and reduce overshoot and oscillations.
